        <h3>Enlisted – Army National Guard</h3>
        <p>Enlisted in the Minnesota Army National Guard during my junior year of high school through the Split Option Program, which allowed me to begin my military service while still completing my education.<br><br>This program gave me a year’s head start on my military career, enabling me to attend Basic Combat Training in the summer of 2019, return to finish my senior year, and then complete my Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) training in the summer of 2020.</p>
